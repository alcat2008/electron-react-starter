# electron-react-starter

Boilerplate to start electron project with a bunch of awesome react technologies.

[Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) application boilerplate based on [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux), [React Router](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router), [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/docs/), [React Transform HMR](https://github.com/gaearon/react-transform-hmr) for rapid application development

This project was forked from repository [electron-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate), and update with some advantages.

## Install

* **Note: requires a node version >= 6 and an npm version >= 3.**

First, clone the repo via git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alcat2008/electron-react-starter.git your-project-name
```

And then install dependencies.
**ProTip**: Install with [yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn) for faster and safer installation

```bash
$ cd your-project-name && npm install
```

:bulb: *In order to remove boilerplate sample code, simply run `npm run cleanup`. After this is run, the initial sample boilerplate code will be removed in order for a clean project for starting custom dev*

## Run

Run these two commands __simultaneously__ in different console tabs.

```bash
$ npm run hot-server
$ npm run start-hot
```

or run two servers with one command

```bash
$ npm run dev
```


## Log

Log state enable is currently persisted by localStorage. You can enable this using localStorage.debug:

```bash
localStorage.debug = 'electron-react:*'
```

And then refresh the page.

*See [electron-debug](https://github.com/sindresorhus/electron-debug) for more information.*

#### DevTools extension

This boilerplate is included following DevTools extensions:

* [Devtron](https://github.com/electron/devtron) - Install via [electron-debug](https://github.com/sindresorhus/electron-debug).
* [React Developer Tools](https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools) - Install via [electron-devtools-installer](https://github.com/GPMDP/electron-devtools-installer).
* [Redux DevTools](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension) - Install via [electron-devtools-installer](https://github.com/GPMDP/electron-devtools-installer).

You can find the tabs on Chrome DevTools.

If you want to update extensions version, please set `UPGRADE_EXTENSIONS` env, just run:

```bash
$ UPGRADE_EXTENSIONS=1 npm run dev

# For Windows
$ set UPGRADE_EXTENSIONS=1 && npm run dev
```



## CSS Modules

This boilerplate out of the box is configured to use [css-modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules).

All `.less` file extensions will use css-modules if is located under `styles/views`.


## Packaging

To package apps for the local platform:

```bash
$ npm run package
```

To package apps for all platforms:

First, refer to [Multi Platform Build](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/wiki/Multi-Platform-Build) for dependencies.

Then,
```bash
$ npm run package-all
```

To package apps with options:

```bash
$ npm run package -- --[option]
```

## Further commands

To run the application without packaging run

```bash
$ npm run build
$ npm start
```

To run End-to-End Test

```bash
$ npm run build
$ npm run test-e2e
```

#### Options

See [electron-builder CLI Usage](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder#cli-usage)

#### Module Structure

This boilerplate uses a [two package.json structure](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/wiki/Two-package.json-Structure).

1. If the module is native to a platform or otherwise should be included with the published package (i.e. bcrypt, openbci), it should be listed under `dependencies` in `./src/package.json`.
2. If a module is `import`ed by another module, include it in `dependencies` in `./package.json`.   See [this ESLint rule](https://github.com/benmosher/eslint-plugin-import/blob/master/docs/rules/no-extraneous-dependencies.md).
3. Otherwise, modules used for building, testing and debugging should be included in `devDependencies` in `./package.json`.

## Static Type Checking
This project comes with Flow support out of the box! You can annotate your code with types, [get Flow errors as ESLint errors](https://github.com/amilajack/eslint-plugin-flowtype-errors), and get [type errors during runtime](https://github.com/gcanti/babel-plugin-tcomb-boilerplate) during development. Types are completely optional.

## Native-like UI

If you want to have native-like User Interface (OS X El Capitan and Windows 10), [react-desktop](https://github.com/gabrielbull/react-desktop) may perfect suit for you.

## How to keep the boilerplate updated

If your application is a fork from this repo, you can add this repo to another git remote:

```sh
git remote add upstream https://github.com/alcat2008/electron-react-starter.git
```

Then, use git to merge some latest commits:

```sh
git pull upstream master
```

## Questions

If appears error when run `npm run dev`, Error: 

```bash
ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/Users/alcat/github/electron-react-starter/node_modules/electron/path.txt'
```

just execute command below

```bash
cd node_modules/electron && node install.js
```
